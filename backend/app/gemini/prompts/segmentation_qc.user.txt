Check the segmentation quality of the following cropped question region.

Context:
- Set ID: {{setId}}
- Question ID: {{questionId}}
- Page number: {{pageNo}}
- Question bounding box (x, y, w, h): {{questionBBox}}

OCR tokens within the question bounding box:
{{ocrTokensJson}}

Detected assets within or overlapping the question bounding box:
{{assetsJson}}

Nearby tokens just outside the question bbox (use these to detect if the crop cuts off content or merges with adjacent questions):
{{nearbyTokensJson}}

Instructions:
1. Check if the crop contains exactly one complete question (not merged with the next/previous question).
2. Check if any part of the question is cut off (top, bottom, left, right).
3. Check if numbering is clear and unambiguous.
4. If the bbox needs adjustment, provide suggested_bbox_adjustment as pixel deltas (dx, dy, dw, dh).
5. Set confidence based on OCR evidence quality and bbox alignment.

Return ONLY the JSON object. No explanation.
